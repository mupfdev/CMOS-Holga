# M64282FP Camera

## What is this all about?

Is it worth upgrading a Holga medium format camera to digital in 2023?
Of course, but at no point should you stop paying homage to
imperfection.

The aim of this project is to use the Mitsubishi M64282FP CMOS image
sensor, which was used in the GameBoy Camera in 1998, in a Holga 120S.
In the tradition of analogue cameras without a display.  Only an SD
memory card is used as a film replacement.

The firmware is rudimentary but fully functional.  The next step is to
install the circuit in a Holga camera.
