# CMOS Holga

## Holga?

The Holga is a medium format 120 film camera, made in Hong Kong, known
for its low-fidelity aesthetic.

The Holga's low-cost construction and simple meniscus lens often yields
pictures that display vignetting, blur, light leaks and other
distortions.  The camera's limitations have brought it a cult following
among some photographers, and Holga photos have won awards and
competitions in art and news photography.

## CMOS?

Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology is used for
constructing integrated circuit (IC) chips, including microprocessors,
microcontrollers, memory chips and other digital logic circuits.  CMOS
technology is also used for analog circuits such as image sensors.

This project is using the infamous Mitsubishi M64282FP.  The M64282FP is
a 128×128 pixel CMOS image sensor with built-in image processing and
analog image output tuning functions.  It can detect an image and
process the image simultaneously as human retinas can.  The sensor is
essentially known for its use in the GameBoy Camera from 1998.

## Best of both worlds
T
deehis project is an attempt to combine the best of both worlds by
mounting the sensor together with an STM32 microcontroller in a Holga
120S as a substitute for the rather expensive 120 roll film.

The firmware is rudimentary but fully functional.  The next step is to
install the circuit in an actual Holga camera.
